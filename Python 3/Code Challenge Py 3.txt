Freudian - 
Send me kisses when it's grey skies
It's been so long look how time flies
If you love me won't you let me know
I've been trying to learn let you go
Call my name whenever tears fall
When you face your fears, you stand tall

Dogtooth - 
She could ride my face
I don't want nothing in return
Her body count and who she fuck ain't never my concern
I'm tryna buy my neighbor house
